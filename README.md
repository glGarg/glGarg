### Hi there, I'm Spandan 👋

😄 A bit about me:
- 📊 I’m currently a Senior Research Scientist at Microsoft (2020 - Present), working on building AI-powered Software Engineering tools.
- 🎓 I recently completed my undergrad in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo (2015 - 2020).
- 🎨 Outside of work, I enjoy [sketching](https://allthestarsinmybackyard.tumblr.com/), running and a few racket sports like Pickleball, Table Tennis and Badminton.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Prior to Data Science, I worked in Game Development and Firmware. Thanks to that, I have my very own [IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11089147/) from my work on Luigi's Mansion 3 as an intern at Nintendo (Next Level Games, Inc.).
